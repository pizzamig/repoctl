# repoctl [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/pizzamig/repoctl.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/pizzamig/repoctl)

repoctl would be a FreeBSD package repository management helper, written in Rust.

It's my first project in rust, so instability, a lot of rewrites and code ugliness is expected
